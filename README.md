ClearPay is a Neobanking web app which allows users to connect multiple bank accounts, view their latest transactions, and send money to other users on the app. With ClearPay, there is no longer a need to manually track your expenses, as the app will update your expenses as they are processed by your connected bank account..

## 📖 Course
- This is my implementation of the JavaScript Mastery DevOverflow Complete Next.js 14 Course: https://www.jsmastery.pro/ultimate-next-course
- The course was worth every penny and greatly increased my confidence as a full-stack developer, with Next.js or any other framework. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to grow as a full-stack developer with a project-based, actionable approach.
