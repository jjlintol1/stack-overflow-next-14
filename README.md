## 📖 Course
- This is my implementation of the JavaScript Mastery DevOverflow Complete Next.js 14 Course: https://www.jsmastery.pro/ultimate-next-course
- The course was worth every penny and greatly increased my confidence as a full-stack developer, with Next.js or any other framework. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to grow as a full-stack developer with a project-based, actionable approach.
